# JKL - On Disrupting Education

### Executive Summary

The traditional 120-credit-hour, four-year undergraduate degree model, emphasizing in-house stay for two years, is increasingly misaligned with current educational and job market demands. The evolving ecosystem is shifting towards micro-credentialing and certifications tailored to specific skills, such as those required for Amazon web server maintenance, rather than broad degree qualifications. This shift reflects a deeper understanding that real learning occurs through practical work and engagement in the field of interest. 

Advancements in AI technology offer unprecedented opportunities for personalized learning paths, allowing individuals to set ambitious goals and receive guidance through resources and exercises. The future may see further integration of AI with certification programs, enhancing collaborative learning and peer exchange within communities. 

This new learning paradigm emphasizes practical, hands-on learning over traditional classroom-based education, recognizing the value of one-on-one interactions, discussion-based learning, and diverse perspectives. It challenges the necessity of a four-year degree as the primary accreditation for employability, advocating for a more flexible, accessible, and relevant approach to education and professional development.

### Notes

- **Traditional Education Model:**
  - 120-credit, four-year degree.
  - Requires in-house stay for significant portion.
  - Misaligned with current job market and educational needs.

- **Shift in Educational Ecosystem:**
  - Moving towards micro-credentialing and certifications.
  - Focus on specific, market-relevant skills.

- **Role of Practical Work:**
  - Real learning happens in the field, through actual work.
  - Proposal to align education with this natural learning process.

- **AI and Personalized Learning:**
  - AI offers tailored learning paths and resources.
  - Potential for AI to connect with certification programs in the future.

- **Collaborative and Peer Learning:**
  - Emphasis on community and peer exchange.
  - Shared learning experiences and skillset exchange.

- **Critique of Traditional Accreditation:**
  - Four-year degrees losing relevance as primary market accreditation.
  - Need for more accessible, relevant forms of accreditation.

- **Personal Insight:**
  - Reflections from a PhD holder on the limitations of traditional education.
  - Value found in practical, discussion-based, and experiential learning over formal classroom education.


## post robo notes

- not just pining for an idealized version of collaborative education (which of course I am)
- it's also **incredibly fucking inefficient**

# JSM - Feedback and Feedforward re: above ^^

Based on the audio transcript from the voice-message.ogg, here is a summary of the main points and a quick semantic outline:

**Main Points:**
1. The proposal content is generally good.
2. The target audience wants ambitious, "pie in the sky" ideas with a sense of urgency.
3. The focus should be on meta-scienceâ€”improving how science is conducted.
4. The current approach is too economics-focused, similar to discussions around education and job market alignment.
5. A shift is needed towards a mentorship model of education that gets students involved in research projects early and allows for specialization.
6. The proposal should emphasize the transformational potential of aligning scientific pursuits with this new educational model, hinting at grand outcomes like immortality and advanced AI.

**Semantic Outline:**
- **Proposal Assessment:** The proposal is solid but needs to align more with the target audience's expectations for transformative ideas.
- **Target Audience's Preferences:** The audience is interested in grand, world-changing ideas with urgency.
- **Meta-Science Emphasis:** The proposal should highlight the concept of improving the scientific process itself.
- **Educational Model Shift:** Recommend transitioning from an economics-centric view to a mentorship-based approach where students engage in research early.
- **Broader Impacts:** Economic and job market considerations should be secondary to the primary focus on educational transformation.
- **Dramatic Outcome:** The proposal should suggest that this reorganization can dramatically accelerate scientific advancements, leading to significant breakthroughs.

This outline should guide the restructuring of the proposal to align with the reviewer's feedback, ensuring it captures
