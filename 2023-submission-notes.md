# Modernizing Scientific Communication

Research becomes 'science' when it is communicated, but our present methods for scientific communication are outdated, archaic, exclusionary by design, and ill-suited for a system of science designed to utilize modern communication technology to serve the actual needs of our current and future civilization http://neural-reckoning.org/reviewing.html.

##Problem Statements

This proposal focuses on two inter-related problems with a proposed solution that assists in both.

### Problem 1: Outdated peer review models

Current peer review relies on siloed email exchanges between editors and isolated reviewers. This closed approach limits transparency and enables inappropriate blocking of novel research. Modern internet technologies enable development of open, collaborative peer review based on communal consensus amongst one's true peers, unimpeded by arbitrary gatekeeping bottlenecks.

For example, see this writeup on a potential model of community peer review.

### Problem 2: Over-reliance on static publications

The standard format of PDF publications makes research communication extremely impoverished compared to the richness of scientific investigation. These "dead and frozen" documents are locked away in proprietary journals, rather than living collaboratively in the open. Research output should be a 'living' and collaborative document focused on scientific research as an ongoing activity rather than a single-shot output.

## Solution: Research reported as a living, collaborative repository


Research may be housed in version controlled public repositories (e.g. Github/GitLab) consisting of:
### Key Artifacts

#### The Main Output (the 'paper' analog)

A human generated/curated 'overview' writeup of the research as a static website (e.g. mkdocs, sphinx)
An arXiv publication (optional)
Subject to communal peer review (e.g. PRs, discussion forums, AI chatbot - see below)

#### The Code

Any code or software utilized, with documentation
Can be collaboratively reviewed/vetted

#### The Data

Relevant data, hosted publicly, anonymized, and protected

#### The Scratch Pad

Notes, unpolished analysis, interim results - a mountain of info that could never fit in a paper
Augmented via journals, videos, public talks

#### The AI Chatbot

An AI/LLM chatbot answering questions about the research
Access to full repository as knowledge source

This less static, communal structure enables richer representation of the actual process and output of research.

## Impact

Transitioning to this collaborative, open model would unlock tremendous benefits for accelerating scientific progress, including:

- Faster translation of research into practical applications
- Increased opportunities for collaboration and community input
- Ability to represent research as a living, evolving process rather than static publication
- Wider participation by removing communication bottlenecks
- AI assistance and knowledge management at previously infeasible scales

The internet provides capabilities simply not available in the era when the existing publication system developed. We must leverage these new opportunities to create scientific communication for the 21st century.
